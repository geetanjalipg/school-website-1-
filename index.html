            <h3>Our mission is to provide a caring, healthy and challenging environment where children prepare to meet with confidence, imagination and integrity the challenges of life.

 

In partnership with supportive families we strive to develop in each child the desire and discipline to grow in wisdom, to lead lives of personal honour, to embrace diversity, to appreciate beauty, to pursue physical well being and to interact with others with a generous and compassionate spirit.

        <h1>The Journey so far
        </h1>

     <h3> The Step By Step School, Noida has grown out of Step by Step Nursery School, a leading preschool in Panchsheel Park New Delhi, synonymous with quality, a loving environment where young children are watched over by a committed and nurturing faculty and a creative curriculum which focuses on learning through activity and play.

 

The Step by Step School, Noida takes forward all these hallmarks of quality and builds on them to provide a unique educational opportunity from preschool to school leaving certification. The senior leadership team of Principal and Heads of School came on board in 2007 and jointly developed a distinctive academic and co-curricular program. The school opened its doors in April 2008 to 547 students from the Toddler programme to class six. Spread over ten acres of land, initially we occupied three floors of the Junior school, the creative play area and the junior playing field. Within a span of two years we expanded to the senior wing, then the admin block in 2013 and finally the state of the art auditorium block in 2018. Presently our school strength stands at 2258, with a staff strength at 336 and a student teacher ratio of 8:1.

 

It is our constant endeavour to keep ourselves updated and introduce teaching methodologies that are based on the latest research in the field of education and to make learning as exciting and meaningful for children as possible. Our enthusiastic team of passionate and caring educators are committed and work tirelessly with young minds. In the past decade the school has put into action a robust curriculum through its numerous programmes that aim in shaping a community of students who are well rounded and rooted to their culture.

 

The school got its CBSE affiliation in 2010 and was authorized to offer the IGCSE examinations and got the IB authorisation in the year 2012. Our first batch of students graduated with flying colours from school in 2014 and every successive batch has fared equally well with the class of 2018 raising the bar further. Meghna Srivastava stood first in the worldwide CBSE class XII Board Examinations in that year. Our students have been placed in reputed colleges in India and abroad and are pursuing courses from engineering, medicine and space sciences to economics, finance and liberal arts, from design and film making to journalism and law.

 

Our commitment to sports has continued to bear fruit. Our students have excelled in different sports. The footballers started learning skills on the junior field and later went on to hone them on the senior field. They have won many laurels for the school; the girls team won the national soccer tournament in 2018, Mehul Sapra played for UP state and Aveka Singh was vice captain for team India which won the SAFF U15 2018 Tournament in Bhutan. Our basketballers started learning their game on the outdoor basketball court but now enjoy the all season indoor basketball court playing other school teams. The swimming pool was inaugurated in 2010 and we have not looked back since. Our swimmers have made a splash at district, state and national level, and our annual Inclusive Swimming Meet is now an important event on the NCR sports calendar. Our special needs student Yash Singh won a bronze medal at the Special Olympics at Los Angeles in 2015. We teach yoga, gymnastics, badminton, tennis, table tennis, volley ball and cricket and they boast of many champions as well.

 

Our rich and varied visual and performing arts programmes have given wings to the creativity of our students. From our first Form Evening in February 2009 have emerged many successive Form Evenings showcasing the best talent in music, dance and drama across the school. The work of our artists, potters, sculptors and photographers have added value to the school campus.

 

An inclusive school by design, SBS Noida has a carefully thought through the special education needs program providing opportunities for differently abled children through their lives in school. The school aims to eliminate prejudice and discrimination, and develop an environment where all children are valued. The Special Education Needs Department supports students with special needs, both in the mainstream classes and in small group settings. Our students have graduated from school through both CBSE, IB and the NIOS curriculums.

 

At the core of the school philosophy lies ‘seva’, our commitment to social outreach and community service. From smaller initiatives with underprivileged schools to larger programmes like Sahyog which started in support of flood devastated villages of Uttarakhand, our students have reached out to serve others from junior school to grade XII.

 

As we move ahead in the journey towards newer frontiers of learning, we will continue to enrich the lives of children, parents and the community.</h3>

        <h2>Counselling
Children with special needs and their families go through a wide range of varying social, behavioural and emotional challenges. The Counselling Dept. provides the necessary support to help them through these difficult periods. This department is also involved in organizing and conducting workshops and awareness programmes for students, parents and staff of the entire school.

 

Parent School Association (PSA)
Details of this are available on the school’s website. The role of the parent who is the SEN PSA representative is to liaise between the school and the parents and communicate issues shared to her /him by individuals or groups of parents.

 

Hierarchy for Parent-school communication: Raising a concern
All teachers have the skills and authority to deal with issues happening in the classroom. Therefore, in case parents have any concerns regarding their child, the first point of contact is the Class Teacher. In case the concern has not been resolved at that level, then the Coordinator will be the next person who should be approached. The Head of the Department will intervene if required. It is important for parents to follow this hierarchy.

 

Parents will not be met in a group. The needs /concerns of parents will be discussed and addressed in individual meetings with them. Issues that are common to a group of parents can be shared with the PSA Rep. who will take it forward with the school authorities.

 

Parent-school communication
All communication between home and school should be through the school diary. Messages to teachers on WhatsApp and other social media will not be entertained. In case of an urgent requirement, parents can also call /SMS teachers on their phones, but only during the specific time period given to them by the concerned teacher.
